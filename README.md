# The Eisenhower Matrix App

## The story

The Eisenhower Matrix is a great tool for time managing and improve your productivity. It is often used in IT projects teams to prioritize tasks.

Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Eisenhower Box, is a productivity tool named after Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States. It's a decision-making framework for organizing tasks based on their urgency and importance. The matrix categorizes tasks into four quadrants:

Urgent and Important: Tasks in this quadrant are both urgent and important, requiring immediate attention. These are typically tasks that contribute directly to your long-term goals or have pressing deadlines.

Important, but Not Urgent: Tasks in this quadrant are important for your long-term goals but don't require immediate attention. These tasks should be scheduled and given appropriate time for completion.

Urgent, but Not Important: Tasks in this quadrant are urgent but don't contribute significantly to your long-term goals. These tasks often involve distractions or interruptions that need to be minimized or delegated if possible.

Not Urgent and Not Important: Tasks in this quadrant are neither urgent nor important. These tasks are typically time-wasters and should be minimized or eliminated from your schedule.
